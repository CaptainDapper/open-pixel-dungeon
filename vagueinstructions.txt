These are the steps I took to build mofoods into OPD. 10/23/2014

1) moved all assets/* to assets/mofoods/*
2) saved icon as 16x16 png named assets/mofoods_icon.png
3) Updated assets file to reflect changes (Eg. added "mofoods/" to all the strings)
4) Updated .dat files to be mod-specific (Eg. added "mofoods-" to all .dat strings)
5) PixelScene extends OPDScene
6) PixelDungeon extends OPDGame, annihilate contents, careful to recreate/override your changes to this file.
7) remember to check for new preferences/other additions to pixeldungeon file
8) displayVersion in TitleScene and RankingsScene
9) Updated WndHero and WndRanking to display version numbers
10) Dungeon.saveGame() use OPDGame.subVersion for bundle version styorage

Lobby Changes
11) created SubGame type
