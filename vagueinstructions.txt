These are the steps I took to build mofoods into OPD. 10/23/2014

1) moved all assets/* to assets/mofoods/*
2) saved icon as 32x32 png named assets/mofoods_icon.png
3) Updated assets file to reflect changes (Eg. added "mofoods/" to all the strings)
4) Updated .dat files to be mod-specific (Eg. added "mofoods-" to all .dat strings)
5) displayVersion in TitleScene
6) Updated onBackPressed in AboutScene
7) Updated WndHero and WndRankings to display version numbers
8) Dungeon.saveGame() use OPDGame.subVersion for bundle version styorage
9) Annihilated the PixelDungeon file
10) remember to check for new preferences
