# Open Pixel Dungeon

This essentially provides a wrapper to choose which mod of the game to use. Not particularly useful right now, but as the number of published mods grows it could show it's strength! If it's done right...

### Status

Work in Progress! There's a lot that needs to be done before I can feel good about calling it a framework

### How to Use
To build your game into the framework, you will need the following sources linked to your game:

https://github.com/00-Evan/PD-classes  
https://github.com/sloanr333/open-pixel-dungeon/tree/opdReady-shattered

If you want to build it with Pixel Dungeon and Shattered Pixel Dungeon(for example) you need the following sources linked:

https://github.com/00-Evan/PD-classes  
https://github.com/sloanr333/open-pixel-dungeon/tree/opdReady-shattered  
https://github.com/sloanr333/open-pixel-dungeon/tree/opdReady-watabou
